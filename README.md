-Energy distribution of particles in a closed box-
The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic processes.
In general, the conservation law states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.
The project was made to simulate this.
